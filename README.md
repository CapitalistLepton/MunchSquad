A food ordering app that will also deliver your food. Customers will login to 
the app and be able to order from several different restaurants and cuisines. 
Once the customer has placed their order, the restaurant will be notified, 
along with any available delivery drivers. When the food is ready, the delivery 
drivers will then drive to the location given by the customer and deliver the 
food.
